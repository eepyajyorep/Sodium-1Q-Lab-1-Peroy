        <h1>Tulips</h1>
        Tulips are spring-blooming perennial flowers that grow from bulbs and are known for their vibrant, 
        cup-shaped blooms. They come in a wide array of colors, including red, yellow, pink, orange, purple, and even white, 
        often with a different colored blotch at the base. Tulips are a popular choice for gardens and bouquets, 
        and they symbolize happiness, love, and good luck.
